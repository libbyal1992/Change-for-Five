 
/* Steps to make change
   I am given 5 dollars for a purchase of $2.33, compute how much change I need to give back.  5.00 - 2.33 = 2.67
   let change = 2.67
   do everything in cents or whole numbers like 100 cents = 1.00 becaause computers don't round very well.
 
   let coins = {dollar:0, quarter:0} do this for nickle and dime and so on.  I won't have pennys becasue the left over amount will be in pennys.  No penny loop.
   first time through the loop it will replace 1 with the object, the second time it will replace 2.  This is how many dollars are in the change variable. 
   We are creating an object called coins with the property of dollar and its value is 0.
  
   while 'change' > 100 then I have a loop, which will
       incriment the number of dollar bills to return. Is there enough change to remove at least one dollar
           coins.dollar++
               this increase the dollar property by 1.
       update 'change' or 100 cents
           change = change - 100
           change -= 100
           This subtracts 100 and updates the change variable
       each time through the loop I'm testing for one dollar
  
   go through all bills starting at the biggest and working my way down.  This discribes the rest of the process
   Ask the questiion does this bill fit?
   Does 1 fit?
   Once I find the bills that fit and repeat the process for coins
   Does 25c fit?
   Does 10c fit?
   Does 5c fit?
   Does 1c fit?
   What if I can return 2 $1 dollar bills?
   The variable called "change" has the amount I'm returning (2.67)
       As we figure a bill to return, we subject that amount from the variable "change" and so "change" represents the amount we haven't determined coins for yet.
   return coins is the last statement
